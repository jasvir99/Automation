NOTE:
# For installing TCC Automation software, make sure that your computer has MYSQL and Django installed.
# This application is tested for Django version 1.4.

In case Django is not installed, install it using :

 wget http://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.4/Django-1.4.2.tar.gz     # download tar folder of django
 tar xzvf Django-1.4.2.tar.gz                                             # opens the tar file
 cd Django-1.4.2                                                          # get into the django folder
 sudo python setup.py install 
       
# In this documentation, replace the "mPath" with the path at which Automation folder is placed.
# Also run following command commands in the terminal :

sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi 
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install django-registration
sudo pip install django-tagging


1. First step to install the TCC Auto software is to download the software from the 
https://github.com/sandeepmadaan/Automation.git
This can be done using command :
sudo git clone https://github.com/sandeepmadaan/Automation.git

Then, extract it and place the extracted folder in the home folder.

2. Open the Automation folder and make the changes in the apache folder and settings.py file. In apache folder there is a “django.wsgi” file which contains sys.path.append(‘mPath’). Here replace mPath with the path at which the Automation folder is placed. Eg. in my case it was in '/home/tcc/'.

Now create a database name automation in your database engine like in my case MySQL.

Now edit the file 'Automation/settings.py'.

Here on line no. 12, it goes like :
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql', # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
        'NAME': 'db_name',                      # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
        'USER': 'db_user',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
        'PASSWORD': 'db_password',
        'HOST': '',                      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
        'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
    }
}

replace db_name with automation or your database name, db_user with your MySQL username, db_password with your MySQL password.
Also change 'HOST':'' to 'HOST': 'localhost', in the above database.

In the settings.py file change please Ensure the following things should be right
LOCAL_URL = 'http://localhost/'
and
MEDIA_URL = 'http://localhost/media/'

    MEDIA_ROOT = '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/'
    {Change the path of media folder to your own path that you follow instead of the path given.)

    Give the path in TEMPLATE_DIRS = ("mPath") in settings.py file of your templates of Automation project as:
    Eg :
    TEMPLATE_DIRS = ("/home/tcc/Automation/templates")
   
There are 2 methods by which you have tables in the software ;
a). Fresh install. i.e create new tables and make all new entries by yourself. This can be done using these commands :
cd Automation
python manage.py syncdb
b). Using this method you can use the demo.sql file already provided by the software and import it in the database created.
 
Now you need to configure the software with apache configuration.
For this you need to make following changes :
There is a file named hhtp_cont in 'Automation/other_files'. Edit this file so that 'mPath' is replaced by your path. Then copy the content and paste it in the file as :

sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

Then save this file and restart the apache using follwing command :

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Now the software is installed. You can open it on browser :
http://localhost/automation

If you have made a fresh install, then you need to make the entry into the tables like tcc_organisation and tcc_department, manually by yourself.
